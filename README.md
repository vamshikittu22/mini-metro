## 1. Overview
**Mini Metro ▲ Web** is a creative technologist's tribute to the iconic transit simulation genre. It challenges players to design an efficient subway layout for a rapidly growing city. Unlike traditional city builders, it focuses on the abstract elegance of transit maps, where efficiency is measured in throughput and aesthetics are defined by Swiss design principles.

### The Problem It Solves
Urban planning is a complex puzzle of resource allocation and flow optimization. This project provides a sandbox to experiment with network topology, identifying bottlenecks and testing the limits of "Hybrid Greedy" routing in a real-time environment.

### Key Differentiators
- **Real-time AI Strategist**: Powered by Google Gemini, providing contextual advice based on your current network load.
- **Data Analytics**: Export detailed Markdown reports of your system's performance, resource usage, and throughput history.
- **Hybrid Greedy Pathfinding**: A sophisticated routing engine that simulates realistic passenger behavior, including transfer penalties and wait-time preferences.

---

## 2. Features & Functionalities

### 🎮 Core Gameplay
- **Real-world Maps**: 8 meticulously mapped cities (London, Paris, NYC, Tokyo, Berlin, Hong Kong, Cairo) with accurate geographic bounds.
- **Dynamic Spawning**: Stations and passengers spawn based on weighted probability and current network saturation.
- **Drag-and-Drop Transit**: Intuitive line creation with automatic 45°/90° angle snapping (elbow paths).
- **Resource Inventory**: Strategic management of Locomotives, Wagons, Tunnels, and Bridges.
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time throughput (delivered passengers) and "Operational Week" progression.

### 🧠 Advanced Systems
- **Hybrid Greedy Pathfinding**: Recursive depth-limited search (max 2 transfers) with station-type reachability verification.
- **Stranded Detection**: Passengers automatically clear after a 30s timeout if their destination becomes unreachable, preventing infinite clutter.
- **Water Crossing Logic**: Dynamic detection of river crossings requiring specific resources (Tunnels vs Bridges).
- **Weekly Reward System**: Level-up loop offering strategic choices between infrastructure expansion packs.

### 🕹️ Game Modes
- **NORMAL**: Standard balanced growth and difficulty scaling.
- **EXTREME**: 1.5x spawn rate and accelerated station overflow timers.
- **ENDLESS**: Stations never overflow; focus purely on network efficiency.
- **CREATIVE**: Unlimited resources and manual station placement tools.

### 🎨 UI/UX
- **Swiss Design**: Minimalist aesthetic with high-contrast typography (Inter font).
- **Responsive Canvas**: Smooth 60FPS rendering with high-performance zoom and pan capabilities.
- **System Auditor**: Background integrity checker that ensures resource counts stay synced between the map and inventory.

---

## 4. Architecture & Design Patterns

### Component Architecture
The application uses a hybrid approach:
1. **React UI Layer**: Handles menus, HUD, AI Strategist interactions, and overlays.
2. **Simulation Layer**: A vanilla TypeScript engine that runs the core game loop (GameEngine.ts).
3. **Rendering Layer**: Decoupled canvas renderer (Renderer.ts) that translates the state into visual elements.

### Service Layer Pattern
Logic is separated into specialized services:
- **GameEngine**: The heart of the simulation (tick management, spawning, train updates).
- **HybridGreedyRouter**: Encapsulates passenger decision-making logic.
- **RouteEvaluator**: Graph-based math for reachability and cost estimation.
- **InventoryManager**: Ensures strict asset accounting.
- **DataLogger**: Handles performance tracking and file exports.

## 5. Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **NPM/PNPM/Yarn**

### Step-by-Step
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-metro-web.git
cd mini-metro-web

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
# Create a .env file in the root directory
# Add your Gemini API Key
echo "API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here" > .env

# 4. Run development server
npm run dev

# 5. Build for production
npm run build
```

---

## 6. Configuration
- **API_KEY**: Required for the Strategist advisor.
- **PATHFINDING_CONFIG**: Located in `src/constants/pathfinding.config.ts`. You can adjust `MAX_TRANSFER_DEPTH` or `COST_PENALTIES` here.
- **GAME_CONFIG**: Located in `src/constants.ts`. Adjust `spawnRate`, `trainSpeed`, and `maxPassengers`.

## 7. Gameplay Guide

### How to Play
1. **Select a City**: Start with London (Difficulty 1.0) to learn the basics.
2. **Create Lines**: Click on a station and drag to another to establish your first transit line.
3. **Manage Trains**: Click the "Loco" icons in the Resource Panel to add trains to your active line.
4. **Expand**: As new stations appear, extend your lines or create new ones using your limited color palette.
5. **Reward Cycle**: Every Sunday, choose between expansion packs to bolster your infrastructure.

### Controls
| Input | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mouse Drag** | Create/Extend Line or Pan Camera (background) |
| **Right-Click** | Delete a line segment |
| **Scroll Wheel** | Zoom In/Out |
| **Speed Buttons** | Pause (0x), Normal (1x), Fast (2x), Ultra (4x) |

## 8. Cities & Difficulty

| City | Difficulty | Initial Stations | Special Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **London** | 1.0 | 3 | The River Thames (Tunnels) |
| **Paris** | 1.1 | 3 | The Seine (Bridges) |
| **NYC** | 1.3 | 3 | Harbor Islands & Tunnels |
| **Tokyo** | 1.5 | 3 | High-density Shinjuku hub |
| **Hong Kong** | 1.8 | 3 | Victoria Harbour (Extreme) |

## 9. Game Mechanics Deep Dive

### Pathfinding Logic (Hybrid Greedy)
The `HybridGreedyRouter` uses a three-phase approach:
1. **Reachability Check**: Uses recursive Depth-Limited Search to see if a destination shape is reachable within 2 transfers.
2. **Boarding Preference**: Passengers compare current train costs vs. waiting 10s for a "better" line.
3. **Transfer Evaluation**: At every stop, passengers check if an intersecting line provides a more efficient path to their goal.

### Resource Scaling
Starting resources are calculated using a difficulty-adjusted base:
`Base * (1 + Difficulty * 0.5)`
This ensures harder cities like Hong Kong start with slightly more equipment to handle the rapid expansion.

## 11. API Integration
The **AI Strategist** uses the `gemini-3-pro-preview` model. It sends a JSON-stringified snapshot of the game state (score, load per station, line density) and requests 3 concise, bulleted improvements.
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttled by the UI to prevent excessive calls.
- **Privacy**: Only abstract game metrics are sent; no personal data is transmitted.

---

## 12. Performance Optimization
- **Canvas Throttling**: The simulation runs at a fixed 60Hz, while React state updates are throttled to 10Hz for optimal UI performance.
- **Pathfinding Cache**: `RouteEvaluator` uses static Maps to cache reachability and cost results, cleared only when the network topology changes.
- **Geometry Caching**: Water polygons are projected once per city load rather than every frame.
